                    In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language
                    description of features of a software system. They are written from the perspective of an end
                    user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in
                    project management software.[1] Depending on the project, user stories may be written by
                    different stakeholders like client, user, manager, or development team.</p>
                <p>
                    User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and
                    may help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context

                        1998: Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A

                        2001: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:

                            <li>
                                The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the
                                concepts;
                            </li>

                                The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers,
                                etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;

                        2004: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his

                        standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler.[8] Cohn names Rachel Davies as
                        the inventor of user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra
                        she credits the team as a whole with the invention

                        published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic
                        approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better
                        visibility to their interdependence.

                    User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the
                    system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is
                    primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog.
                    In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion
                    with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.

                <h3>Common templates</h3>

                <p>User stories may follow one of several formats or templates.</p>

                <p>The most common is the Connextra template, stated below.[12][7][13] Mike Cohn suggested the "so
                    that" clause is optional although still often helpful.</p>

                <code>
                   As a  < role > I can < capability > , so that < receive benefit> 
               </code>

                <p>Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully delivering
                    software, and proposed this alternative</p>

                <code>
                In order to < receive benefit> as a < role>, I can < goal/desire>

                <p>
                    As the HR manager, I want to create a screening quiz so that I can understand whether I want to
                    send possible recruits to the functional manager.[17]
                </p>

                <h3>Quiz Recall</h3>
                <p>
                    As a manager, I want to browse my existing quizzes so I can recall what I have in place and
                    figure out if I can just reuse or update an existing quiz for the position I need now

                <p>As a user, I can indicate folders not to back up so that my backup drive isn't filled up with
                    things I don't need saved.</p>

                <p>
                    A central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning game, user
                    stories describe what may be built in the software project. User stories are prioritized by the
                    customer (or the product owner in Scrum) to indicate which are most important for the system and
                    will be broken down into tasks and estimated by the developers. One way of estimating is via a
                    Fibonacci scale.

                    When user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have the possibility to
                    talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be difficult to interpret, may require some
                    background knowledge or the requirements may have changed since the story was written.

                    User stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. This can include notes,
                    attachments and acceptance criteria.

                <code
        >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");

                    There is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer
                    productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which
                    is linked to success

                <p>
                    Common approaches to sizing user stories include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Story Points: User stories are often given a 'size' based on a team's opinion of how long it
                        might take to deliver, to do this, they will allocate a number of story points to the story. A
                        story point is an arbitrary and inconsistent indicator of the team's opinion of size, at a point
                        in time. The points allocation is usually based on a Fibonacci scale.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        T-shirt sizes: This is similar to story points in that it is the team's opinion. It is a less
                        granular indicator of size than story points.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        COSMIC Function Points: This is a 2nd generation ISO standard software sizing methodology suited
                        to agile software development where not all requirements are known up-front
